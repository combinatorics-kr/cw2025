[Combinatorics Workshop (조합론 학술대회)](https://www.combinatorics.kr/workshop/combinatorics-workshop) is an annual conference for researchers in combinatorics and related areas in Korea.
It was started in 2004 by the Yonsei University BK21 Research Group. Since 2013, this workshop has been advised by the committee of discrete mathematics of the Korean Mathematical Society. This year, it will occur at the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) in Daejeon from August 18 to August 20, 2025.

The 2025 Combinatorics Workshop will start in the afternoon of August 18 (Monday) and end in the afternoon of August 20 (Wednesday).
There will be several invited talks and contributed talks.

Using English is recommended if there are non-Korean participants in the audience.
