                <div id="abstract1" class="abstract">
                    <p>A finite-state automaton is a computing machine ("algorithm") of primitive form, which scans a given string over a finite alphabet, e.g. a string consisting of 0's and 1's, and decides if the given string is in some language. It is primitive in the sense that the machine does not have a memory, and the machine keeps track of the inner working of the algorithm by having a "state", out of a finite number of possible states, which is updated according to a hard-wired rule as the machine reads the symbols on the input string one by one. A set of strings ("language") recognized by a finite automaton is known as a regular language. It is well-known that a regular language is precisely described by a homomorphism from the set of all strings to a finite semigroup. A less known but nonetheless important is that a language is regular if and only it is defined by so called Monadic Second Order Logic (Büchi-Elgot-Trakhtenbrot 1960), MSO logic in short. As a consequence, a language that can be defined using MSO logic admits an efficient algorithm for membership test, marking a regular language precisely as a language in which logical, algebraic and algorithmic behavior squarely meet. And these nice characterizations generalize to labelled trees, which extends the path-like shape inherent in strings (Thatcher and Wright, 1968). Courcelle's theorem (Courcelle 1990, Courcelle-Makowski-Rotices 2000) radically broadened the applications of Büchi-Elgot-Trakhtenbrot theorem on the equivalence of "recognizability and definability" on strings. Many fundamental graph problems can be expressed using MSO logic. And many such problems can be efficiently solved via so-called dynamic programming algorithms when the input graph is tree-like, e.g. has constant treewidth or constant cliquewidth. Courcelle's theorem revealed that the availability of dynamic programming algorithms for those problems is not a coincidence by showing that any MSO-definable graph problem has a nice algebraic property. This in turn leads to a meta-algorithm, which is a finite-state (tree) automaton in essence. Whether the opposite implication holds on graph with tree-like structures, thus allowing a nice characterization akin to those on strings and labelled trees, was asked by Courcelle himself (1990). The converse statement of Courcelle's theorem turns out to hold. It is proved by Bojańczyk and Pilipczuk (2016) that if such a nice algebraic property holds for a graph property, the property admits a logical description by MSO logic on graphs of bounded treewidth. As Courcelle's theorem holds on graphs of bounded cliquewidth as well as on matroids of bounded branchwidth when representable over a finite field, it is conjectured that "recognizability equals definability" on these more general structures. In this talk, we overview how algorithms design is intrinsically intertwined with algebraic and logical aspects of problems on graphs with tree-like structure. We also give a brief overview on essential, powerful tools for tackling these conjectures. </p>

                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davin Choo, Billy Jin, Yongho Shin<br>Online bipartite matching is a fundamental problem in online optimization, extensively studied both in its integral and fractional forms due to its theoretical significance and practical applications, such as online advertising and resource allocation. Motivated by recent progress in learning-augmented algorithms, we study online bipartite fractional matching when the algorithm is given advice in the form of a suggested matching in each iteration. We develop algorithms for both the vertex-weighted and unweighted variants that provably dominate the naive "coin flip" strategy of randomly choosing between the advice-following and advice-free algorithms. Moreover, our algorithm for the vertex-weighted setting extends to the AdWords problem under the small bids assumption, yielding a significant improvement over the seminal work of Mahdian, Nazerzadeh, and Saberi (EC 2007, TALG 2012). Complementing our positive results, we establish a hardness bound on the robustness-consistency tradeoff that is attainable by any algorithm. We empirically validate our algorithms through experiments on synthetic and real-world data. </p>

                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmad Abdi, Dabeen Lee<br>Combinatorial optimization is the problem of choosing an optimal combination of items from a discrete set of elements. One of the most pressing challenges in modern applications is to develop efficient methodologies for nonlinear combinatorial optimization. In this talk, we introduce a novel approach to solving nonlinear problems through the lens of boolean polynomials and binary matroids. Discovering previously unrecognized connections to binary matroids, we develop a new framework for linearizing the equivalent boolean polynomial optimization formulation. We provide a simple characterization for the convex hull of binary solutions to the linearization when the underlying binary matroid is a projective geometry, which contains all binary matroids over the same ground set as restrictions. We also show that if the matroid satisfies the sums of circuits property, then the convex hull coincides with the associated cocycle polytope. Moreover, taking the signs of the objective coefficients into account, we extend the sums of circuits property to idealness of binary clutters via signed binary matroids. To go further beyond the sums of circuits property, we present a sum-of-squares hierarchy that admits efficient semidefinite relaxations. Lastly, we explain extensions to discrete optimization over any finite fields. </p>

In this paper, we prove a Ramsey-Turán variant of Roth's theorem, with respect to a natural notion of "structured" sets introduced by Erdős and Sárközy in the 1970's.

                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ingyu Baek, Joonkyung Lee<br>Sidorenko's conjecture states that, for all bipartite graphs H, quasirandom graphs asymptotically minimises the number of copies of H taken over all graphs with fixed density p. Although this conjecture has remained open for decades, its natural hypergraph generalisa-tion is known to be false since Sidorenko's own work in the 1990s, which shows that, for a 3-uniform loose 3-cycle C<sub>3</sub><sup>(3)</sup>, there exists a 3-uniform hypergraph G with edge density p such that t(C<sub>3</sub><sup>(3)</sup>,G) &lt; p<sup>3</sup>, where t(H,G) denotes the homomorphism density of H in G. In 2020, with interesting applications in additive combinatorics, Fox, Sah, Sawhney, Stoner, and Zhao showed that the inequality t(C<sub>3</sub><sup>(3)</sup>,G) &ge; p<sup>4</sup> holds and furthermore, the exponent 4 cannot be improved by a smaller number. The tightness of the exponent is demonstrated by Behrend's 3-AP-free set construction, which necessarily requires p tending to zero as |V(G)| tends to infinity. One may then ask whether the tightness of the exponent in the Fox-Sah-Sawhney-Stoner-Zhao inequality can be evidenced by an arbitrary 'dense' hypergraph G, e.g., p=1/2. An analogous question for graphs was recently asked by Blekherman, Raymond, Razborov, and Wei. We answer this question in the negative, by obtaining nontrivial lower-order terms in the lower bound for t(C<sub>3</sub><sup>(3)</sup>,G) beyond p<sup>4</sup>. Our method also generalises to longer loose odd cycles, which can be seen as a progress towards a recent question of Spiro and Nie. </p>

                    <p>(in honor of Professor Dongsu Kim's retirement)<br>Integer partitions carry various interesting statistics. Of those, the most loved and studied statistics are Dyson's rank and crank, which explain Ramanujan's mod 5, 7 and 11 partition congruences. In 1990, Garvan, Kim and Stanton found other cranks, which split the set of partitions into t equinumerous classes for t=5,7,11 and thus give a combinatorial account for the three congruences of Ramanujan. In their proof, the Littlewood decomposition of partitions into t-core and t-quotient partitions is an essential component. Since then, their cranks along with Dyson's rank and crank have been adopted to prove other partition congruences and refinements. In this talk, I will discuss the Littlewood decomposition from a partition theory point of view and present some recent results on various partition statistics arising from the Littlewood decomposition. This talk is based on joint work with Hyunsoo Cho, Byungchan Kim and Eunmi Kim. </p>

                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Inseo Kim, Eunjeong Lee<br>Let G be a simple algebraic group over C, and let P be a parabolic subgroup of G. A flag variety G/P is a smooth projective homogeneous variety that admits an action of a maximal torus T of G, where T is contained in the parabolic subgroup P. Schubert varieties form an interesting family of T-invariant subvarieties of G/P indexed by elements of a certain coset of the Weyl group of G. Note that not every Schubert variety is toric with respect to the induced T-action. In this talk, we consider toric Schubert varieties in G/P when G is of type A. </p>

Since then, there have been various works on the largest size of a core partition. In particular, Nam and Yu computed the largest size of an (s,s+1)-core partition, where all the parts are of the same parity. In this paper, we evaluate the largest size of an (s,s+2)-core partition, where all the parts are of the same parity. </p>

                <div id="abstract16" class="abstract">
                    <p>Treewidth is a well-known graph parameter that plays an important role in Robertson and Seymour's graph minors project. Several width parameters inspired by treewidth have been introduced for digraphs, including directed treewidth, directed pathwidth, DAG-width, Kelly-width, cycle rank, DAG-depth, and so on. Compared to undirected width parameters, finding unavoidable structures for digraph width parameters turns out to be very difficult. Recently, we provided a collection of three obstruction families for cycle rank in terms of butterfly minors. In this talk, we present this result and related open problems. This is joint work with Meike Hatzel, Myounghwan Lee, and Sebastian Wiederrecht. </p>

                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meike Hatzel, O-joung Kwon, Myounghwan Lee, Sebastian Wiederrecht<br>Cycle rank is one of the depth parameters for digraphs introduced by Eggan in 1963. We show that there exists a function f:N→N such that every digraph of cycle rank at least f(k) contains a directed cycle chain, a directed ladder, or a directed tree chain of order k as a butterfly minor. Directed cycle chains and directed ladders are strongly connected digraphs that are obtained from an undirected path by splitting its edges or vertices in a specific way. A directed tree chain of order k is obtained from a directed path v<sub>1</sub>v<sub>2</sub>...v<sub>2<sup>k</sup></sub> by adding the edge (v<sub>2<sup>i</sup>j</sub>,v<sub>2<sup>i</sup>j+2<sup>i</sup>-1</sub>) for every i∈{1,...,k} and j∈{1,...,2<sup>k-i</sup>}. We also investigate a new connection between cycle rank and a directed analogue of the weak coloring number of graphs. </p>

                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seokbeom Kim, Taite LaGrange, Mathieu Rundström, Sophie Spirkl<br>If a graph has large clique-width, what can we say about its induced subgraphs? From classical results on clique-width, it is not hard to deduce that the class of H-free graphs has bounded clique-width if and only if H is an induced subgraph of a four-vertex path. Here, a graph is H-free if it has no induced subgraph isomorphic to H. Motivated by this result, there have been studies on the clique-width of graphs excluding two or more graphs as induced subgraphs, as well as H-free graphs with additional structural properties. In this talk, we investigate an analogue of this question for tournaments, which are a special type of directed graph. Again, what can we say about subtournaments of a tournament with large (directed) clique-width? We present recent progress on this question along with some open problems. </p>
